<h2>Our Story and Purpose</h2>
<p>Created to serve both users looking for an immediate solution for quick notes and those who need a more robust system for task management, <strong>Notepad Online</strong> was born from the idea of transforming the simple act of taking notes into an organized and effortless experience. Initially designed to be used directly in the browser—without the need for downloads or installations—the site has evolved to incorporate modern features, such as cloud storage through Google Firebase technology. This evolution was developed to meet users' needs, who today require secure and synchronized access to their data across different devices.</p>
