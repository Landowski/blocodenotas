<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>At Online Notepad (blocodenotasonline.com.br), we respect your privacy and are committed to handling your data securely and transparently. Our tool allows you to create and save notes and task lists both locally in your browser and in the cloud using Firebase.

Firebase employs advanced security measures to protect stored data, including encryption and authentication. Additionally, we only use the data strictly necessary to ensure the app's functionality, such as your registered email.</p>
